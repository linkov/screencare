Screencare
==========
This is an iOS library that can be integrated to your app to make screenshots with annotations and send them with your comments and user device info to a project management service like Basecamp or Slack. Right now Uploadcare (http://uploadcare.com) is used for file storage and Slack is used as a service that receives images with comments.

Currently Screencare intercepts system screenshot - HOME+Power, but gestures as triggers can be added easily.
